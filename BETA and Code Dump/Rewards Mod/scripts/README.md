<b>Beta selection of Reward Mod missions</b><br>
Copy into your DMS.PBO\scripts <br>
Add "class PlayerRewardsMod 			{};" to "class compiles" list in DMS.PBO config.cpp<br>
We should be able now to call 	[DMS_fn_PlayerRewardsMod,[_cash,_score,_crate_loot_values,_PrizeVehicles];], inside missions<br>
Save/repack/Upload to server <br>
When the mission crashes horribly please let me know what it says :) <br><br><br>

not sure of trailing semi-colon on end of call so try with and without but not sure it will all work.<br>
As I don't run this mod I cant debug myself so please use this as a starting point only.<br>

<b>Not recommended for live servers</b><br>
Please report any BETA mission issues or comments (especially if they are working) so i can add them to the live package<br>

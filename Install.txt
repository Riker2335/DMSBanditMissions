*******************************************************
	For ANY MAP.
	Running on DMS System
	Built on DMS_Version: "July 3, 2016"

Updated 10 March 2017 > V3.1 - Release
Added new nedcashbandits_mission with %vehicle and cash prize

Updated 16 July 2016 > V 3.0 - Release
1. Changed the random call from 
_difficulty = _PossibleDifficulty call BIS_fnc_selectRandom;
to
_difficulty = selectRandom _PossibleDifficulty;
2. Changed difficulty match from
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "easy") then {
to
switch (_difficulty) do
{	case "easy":	{
*** #1 and #2 is to match the way DMS has released some of the missions from this pack and to make updates easier in the future ***
3. Consolidated start messages into 1 line as I saw how eraser1 had changed scripts for including into DMS and realised I missed a trick as this reduces the amount of lines in the script.
4. Consolidated some of the item content choices as I had listed the same lines in all outcomes but really just needed to list once to reduce size of script (again thanks eraser1).
5. Adjusted some spacing, line breaks and tabs as it reduces the overall size and was not really needed.
6. Changed terrorists to bandits to keep in the Bandit Missions theme, and corrected some English grammar.
7. Added % chance of persistent vehicle to more missions so it can be adjusted by user.
8. Changed CoinToss possibilities a % number.
9. Removed several mistakes in brackets - I don't know how I missed them or why it worked anyway but I fixed them.
10. Balanced some AI and loot as they were a little under or over what you would expect from the missions.
11. Added a graded %chance for persistent vehicles on some missions - check the spreadsheet for details.
12. ***NEW MISSION*** - nedbandit1, no crate but loot and cash spawn inside the vehicle. This has almost every function I have been working on inside including 2 groups of custom AI - kind of like the old Mayor missions of the Arma 2 days where one Ai is dressed differently from the rest. It is a working concept and "how to" mission so not only works as a mission but can help people design and release more of their own.

*******************************************************
Installing.
1. 	Copy contents of this folder>/missions/bandit/ into a3_dms.pbo /missions/bandit/ , you can remove old missions.
2. 	Copy contents of this folder>/objects/ into a3_dms.pbo /objects/ , you do not have to replace any already in there (files dont go in the static folder)
3. 	Extract main config.sqf
4.	Find
	DMS_BanditMissionTypes =
5.	Replace current list of missions between [] or add in the new ones, this is mine as i balanced the new missions the same as their stock mission using 3 as normal mission priority (you dont really need the old versions of any of the Bandit missions as they are all replaced in this file).


	DMS_BanditMissionTypes =			[			//	List of missions with spawn chances. If they add up to 100%, they represent the percentage chance each one will spawn

6.	Repack config.sqf and folders into PBO
7. 	Put a3_dms.pbo back into /@ExileServer/addons/ on server and start.

No BE or InfiSTAR additions apart from what you installed to run DMS. this will not run without DMS. 

You can edit the mission text by changing the following in sqf mission files (depending which one you want to edit) 
// Define Mission Start message
_msgStart = ['#FFFF00',"A DIY storage is under attack! Go kill the attackers"];

// Define Mission Win message
_msgWIN = ['#0080ff',"Convicts grabbed all the building materials"];

// Define Mission Lose message
_msgLOSE = ['#FF0000',"The attackers stole everything!"];

// Define mission name (for map marker and logging)
_missionName = "Building Materials";


Random choice of difficulty is now done from selecting from a list

//create possible difficulty add more of one difficulty to weight it towards that
_PossibleDifficulty		= 	[	
								"easy",
								"moderate",
								"difficult",
								"hardcore"
							];

Each difficulty has 25% chance but you can manipulate it to be more inclined to chose a difficulty over another by adding more lines e.g.

_PossibleDifficulty		= 	[	
								"easy",
								"easy",
								"moderate",
								"difficult",
								"hardcore"
							];
easy = 40% rest is 20% each

_PossibleDifficulty		= 	[	
								"easy",
								"easy",
								"easy",
								"easy",
								"moderate",
								"moderate",
								"moderate",
								"moderate",
								"difficult",
								"hardcore"
							];
easy = 40% and moderate = 40% and only 10% for each of the others

//Selections to chose from once difficulty has been decided>
//easy
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "easy") then {
_AICount = (3 + (round (random 2)));
_crate_weapons 		= (2 + (round (random 3)));
_crate_items 		= (2 + (round (random 4)));
_crate_backpacks 	= 1;
								};
//moderate
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "moderate") then {
_AICount = (4 + (round (random 2)));
_crate_weapons 		= (4 + (round (random 5)));
_crate_items 		= (4 + (round (random 6)));
_crate_backpacks 	= 2;			
								};
//difficult
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "difficult") then {
_AICount = (4 + (round (random 3)));
_crate_weapons 		= (6 + (round (random 7)));
_crate_items 		= (6 + (round (random 8)));
_crate_backpacks 	= 3;
								};
//hardcore								
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "hardcore") then {
_AICount = (4 + (round (random 4)));
_crate_weapons 		= (8 + (round (random 9)));
_crate_items 		= (8 + (round (random 10)));
_crate_backpacks 	= 4;
								};
